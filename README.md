# Pedestrian Behavior Simulation and Visualization
Master thesis project at Atkins, Spring 2019.

### Title
Interactive Visualization of Agent-Based Model: Pedestrian Behavior at Signalized Pedestrian Crossings.

### Abstract
The pedestrian behavior at the signalized crossings is not linearly predictable. Whether each pedestrian will eventually jump a red light is influenced by the individual difference, environmental interaction, and the impact from other people. Therefore, an agent-based model (also known as individual-based model) can be established to simulate the pedestrian behavior at the crossings. Besides modeling, this thesis also interprets these phenomena using interactive visualization, where environmental aspect of office area intensity is adjustable. The updated simulation afterward appears in real time. This visualization tool would contribute to the digitalization of regional planning workflow by involving the pedestrian safety computationally.
